# GitHub Instructions

Here are the steps to use this repository with GitHub Desktop:

1. Install GitHub Desktop if you don't already have it:
   - Go to https://desktop.github.com/ and click on "Download for..." to download the version for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation prompts.

2. Clone the repository:
   - Open GitHub Desktop and click "File > Clone repository".
   - Enter the URL of this repository (`https://github.com/cecilsmith/GPS-MINPOINT.git`) and select a local path where you want the repository contents to be downloaded.
   - Click "Clone".
   
3. Make changes and commit:
   - Open the repository in your preferred text editor or IDE.
   - Make your changes to the files.
   - Go back to GitHub Desktop. You should see the changed files listed in the left panel.
   - If you haven't already, change your current branch to be something new/named after the changes you are working on--this will avoid accidental overwrites of the 'main' branch.
   - Enter a commit message summarizing your changes and then click "Commit to branch".
   
4. Push your changes:
   - In GitHub Desktop, click "Push origin" to push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub. 
   
5. Pull latest changes:
   - If someone else has modified the code click "Fetch origin" to retrieve them.
   - To merge the updates into your local repository, click "Pull origin".
